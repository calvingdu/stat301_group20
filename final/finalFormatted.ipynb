    "Total Body Water (TBW) is a physiological indicator that reflects how much water is contained in an individuals body. As such, TBW varies with characteristics such as tissue type and overall body size. For example, lean tissue (muscles and organs) contains approximately 70–75% water, whereas fat tissue carries only about 10% (Lorenzo et al., 2019). Basic anthropometric traits such as height, weight, BMI, and gender also relate to TBW because they reflect differences in body size and composition (Ritz et al., 2008).  \n",

    "Using the variables available in this dataset, we aim to confirm well-established associations, (such as those involving lean mass and body fat ratio, while also exploring the influence of variables that have been less frequently examined, such as gender.\n",

    "**How do lean mass, gender, body fat ratio, BMI, and other anthropometric measurements individually and jointly explain variation in total body water?** \n",

    "To address this question, several multiple linear regression (MLR) models will be fit using totalbodywatertbw as the response variable and differing \n",
    "combinations of covariates as predictors. The primary goal is statistical inference about how these variables relate to TBW. In addition, lasso regression will be used to identify which covariates contribute most effectively within this dataset."

    "- $\\hat{\\beta_3} = -0.83$ is the coefficient for extracellularfluidtotalbodywaterecftbw. Keeping all other predictors constant, a 0.1 increase in the extracellular fluid ratio is associated with a 0.83L decrease in the estimated total body water.\n",
    "- $\\hat{\\beta_4} = -0.0095$ is the coefficient for musclemassmm. Keeping all other predictors constant, a 1 unit increase in the muscle mass is associated with a 0.0095L decrease in the estimated total body water. The estimated coefficient is very small hence does not appear to have a significant impact on total body water.\n",
    "- $\\hat{\\beta_5} = 0.063$ is the coefficient for visceralmuscleareavmakg. Keeping all other predictors constant, a 1 unit increase in the visceral muscle area is associated with a 0.063L increase in the estimated total body water. The value is gain very small and hence does not appear to have a significant impact on total body water.\n",

    "$H_0 : \\beta_j = 0$ vs $H_1 : \\beta_j \\ne 0$\n",

    "\n",
    "**Based on p-values,** at a 5% significance level, we can say that the only statistically significant predictors are extracellularwaterecw (ECW) and extracellularfluidtotalbodywaterecftbw (ECF/TBW ratio) because their p-value < 0.05. Gender, muscle mass and VMA are not statistically significant predictors because their p-values > 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison to other models:**\n",
    "Compared with a full model that includes all predictors, the LASSO selected model is simpler and more interpretable. It is also statistically efficient since less important variables have been removed, hence preventing overfitting. This model also helps us focus on inference, allowing us to state clearly that ECW and ECF/TBW ratio are the most important features associated with Total Body Water. \n",

    "Therefore, these results answer our scientific question of understanding the association between an individual's total body water and other predictors. Also, they help us identify which body composition features contribut the most to Total body water.
